    "overview": "The Flip Side explores the untold story of Asaram Bapu’s ashram during the turbulent period of the 2013 media-fueled trial. While the public narrative was dominated by sensational headlines that painted their guru as guilty before the courts could speak, the film turns its lens to the community of ashramites who found themselves at the center of a storm they never invited.\n\nRather than repeating the familiar frames of scandal and controversy, this story uncovers how disciples—who saw Asaram Bapu not just as a spiritual teacher but as a guardian of cultural and civilizational values—coped with the sudden dismantling of their world. Through their memories, struggles, and resilience, The Flip Side reveals a parallel truth: the emotional, spiritual, and social upheaval of a community caught between faith and a hostile media landscape.\n\nAt its heart, the film asks: what happens when an entire spiritual ecosystem is neutralized overnight—not by verdict, but by narrative?",
